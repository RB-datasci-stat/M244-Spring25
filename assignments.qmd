## Homework

All homework assignments will be submitted to Gradescope.

0.  Course Information sheet. This is due **Thursday, January 30th.**

## Essays

1.  *My Coding Autobiography.* This is open ended and some things you
    can include are:\
    \* When did you start coding and why?\
    \* How do you learn coding?\
    \* What have been your biggest successes and struggles with coding?\
    \* What are your coding goals?\

    Try to not go over 2 pages for this, and it is fine if your essay is
    only a couple paragraphs. At the end of the essay, please note if
    you used generative AI to help write it or not, and why. It is up to
    you to use this technology. I am interested in understanding why
    people use (or do not use) it.\
    \
    At the bottom of your essay, please indicate if you are willing to
    share this with the class in the Google Drive. I think many people
    will enjoy reading your essay as it will help us connect with one
    another. However, I understand if you want to keep this more
    private.\
    \
    This is due **Tuesday, February 4th** in Gradescope.
