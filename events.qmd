**February 12-13.** The [Henry Seely White
lectures](https://pages.vassar.edu/mathstats/hsw-lecture-series/) this
year will be given by [Professor Xiao-Li
Meng](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/xiao-li-meng).

**April 11-13.** [DataFest](https://pages.vassar.edu/datafest/) is a
data analysis competition where teams of up to five students have a
weekend to attack a large, complex, and surprise dataset. Work together
with your team members and consult with mentors to find and communicate
insights into these data. The teams that impress the judges the most
will win prizes. Everyone else will have a great experience, learn some
new skills, and have fun! Registration for this year's event will soon
be available.
